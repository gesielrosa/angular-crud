# Angular Crud

This codebase was created to demonstrate a application built with Angular that interacts with an actual backend server, including CRUD operations,
routing, end-2-end tests, and more. I am gone to great lengths to adhere to the Angular Styleguide & best practices.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
